            <h1 class="title">Dolphin</h1>
            <p> A dolphin is an aquatic mammal within the infraorder Cetacea. Dolphin species belong to the 
                families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), 
                Iniidae (the New World river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct 
                Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species named as dolphins.
                    
                Dolphins range in size from the 1.7-metre-long (5 ft 7 in) and 50-kilogram (110-pound) 
                Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31 ft 2 in) and 10-tonne (11-short-ton) orca. Various species 
                of dolphins exhibit sexual dimorphism where the males are larger than females. They have 
                streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible 
                as seals, some dolphins can briefly travel at speeds of 29 kilometres (18 mi) per hour or leap 
                about 30 feet (9.1 m). Dolphins use their conical teeth to capture fast-moving prey. They 
                have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water. It is so well developed 
                that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great 
                depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.

                Dolphins are widespread. Most species prefer the warm waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the 
                right whale dolphin, prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like 
                the orca, feed on large mammals such as seals. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every 
                year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer 
                months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse 
                their young for a relatively long period of time.

                Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in 
                the form of clicks and whistles. Dolphins are sometimes hunted in places such as Japan, in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. 
                Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, habitat loss, and marine pollution.
                Dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. Dolphins occasionally feature in literature 
                and film, as in the film series Free Willy. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to 
                perform tricks. The most common dolphin species in captivity is the bottlenose dolphin, while there are 
                around 60 orcas in captivity.

        <p> The dolphin ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as 
            an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. 
            In dolphins, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner 
            environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, dolphins receive 
            sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the 
            inner ear. The dolphin ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, 
            which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks 
            from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing 
            a melon will have a large depression. This allows dolphins to use echolocation for orientation. 
            Though most dolphins do not have hair, they do have hair follicles that may perform some sensory 
            function. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin" target="blank">For more information click me.</a>
